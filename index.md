**Postdoctoral Researcher, UC Santa Barbara**  
Experimental Particle Physics · CMS Collaboration · milliQan . FORMOSA

I work on searches for **long-lived particles (LLPs)** with the **CMS experiment at the LHC** (Run-3), including **delayed-jet** signatures and **novel trigger development**. I also contribute to **milliQan/FORMOSA** searches for **millicharged particles** at CERN.  
Previously, I completed my PhD at **UC Berkeley (ATLAS)** on **non-pointing and delayed photons** in $pp$ collisions at $\sqrt{s}=13~\text{TeV}$.
